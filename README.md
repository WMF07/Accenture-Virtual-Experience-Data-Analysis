# Accenture-Virtual-Experience-Data-Analysis

Social Buzz is a social media conglomerate which emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. 
Accenture is running a 3 month initial project and is tasked the following:
- An audit of their big data practice. 
- Recommendations for a successful IPO. 
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
 

**Problem** - The problem being faced by Social Buzz is the challenge of effectively managing and analysing the massive amount of unstructured data generated from their rapidly growing user base. 
The company needs to find a solution to efficiently handle and maintain this complex technology infrastructure.
